# GuitarStringClassifier
This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify guitar strings based on spectrogram images. Original audios can be found by clicking the onedrive link found in audios.txt.

To run the spectogram extractor simply specify the folder path of the audios as well as the folder you would like the spectograms to be saved to like this: 
 python SpectogramExtractor.py TrainingAudios TestFolder

Refer to the JupyterNotebook to see details on how the model performed and how the CNN was trained.
